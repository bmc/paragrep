*paragrep* is a "paragraph grep" utility. It searches for a series of
regular expressions in a text file (or several text files) and prints out
the paragraphs containing those expressions. Normally paragrep displays a
paragraph if it contains any of the expressions; this behavior can be
modified by using the -a option.
